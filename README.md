# TI-Utilities
A repository that contains my programs made for the TI 84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator in TI-Basic.

These programs can be edited using TI-Connect CE software. This software is available for free from TI's website. Documentation for each program can be found in the wiki section of this repository.
